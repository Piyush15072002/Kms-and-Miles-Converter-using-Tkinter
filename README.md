# Kms-and-Miles-Converter-using-Tkinter
 


There are 2 project files.


- `main.py` is the main file of the project which is responsible to initialize the object/window and put it in the mainloop.


- `converter.py` contains the public class which has the window setup and all the crucial methods for the converter. This class is loaded in the main file and from there an object is initialized by passing keyworded arguments.

#### Execute the `main.py` to run your project. One important note for users is that - You can use the **CLASS** for your own projects and modify it as per your use.

###### This mini project is developed to enhance learning and understanding of Python, TKinter, and advanced arguments. Anyone who wishes to explore and extend this project is welcome and I will happily add them as a collaborator. Thank you.
